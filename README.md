# Spectrum

## NOTE
This version of Spectrum is a **severely** slimmed-down version, as compared with the previous [MyAnalysis](www.github.com/gibsjose/MyAnalysis) software. This is due to upgrades being made on the front-end of the software, as well as a re-design of the program structure. Spectrum will grow as more parts of MyAnalysis are re-designed, cleaned up, and ported over.
